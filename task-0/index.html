        <p data-testid="shortBio">I am a creative thinker passionate about coding, writing, and design. With a keen interest in blending technology and storytelling, they experiment with web development projects, from interactive calculators to drum machines. Their Substack, Ofuje's Rough Drafts, showcases their evolving ideas and narratives, including The Rwandaring, a reflective piece on self-discovery. Currently, they're working through The Odin Project and HNG internship to sharpen their coding skills while also exploring books like Atomic Habits to grow in multiple areas of life. Always seeking to develop original perspectives rather than inherit them, Ofuje is on a journey of continuous learning and creativity.</p>
